      <meta name="description" content="A free catalog for searching and downloading Sentinel 2 and Landsat 5, 7, 8  full archive imagery

The catalog service provides full access to all Landsat 5, 7, and 8 and Sentinel 2a scenes and our database is updated daily.
We focus on simplicity. The catalog offers the basic search parameterization by geographic name (we support national objects and subnational objects at the first administrative level and as an ‘Add On’ the Mexican National Protected Areas. However, this is extendable to whatever geographic object), Sensor (of either Landsat 5, Landsat 7, Landsat 8, or Sentinel 2), date range of image acquisition, and maximum cloud coverage per scene. The catalog search results are aggregated on Landsat’s path/row grid and the Sentinel’s granule grid, respectively. The search results map representation presents the spatial-quantitative aggregation of registered datasets that fit the search parameters. The detailed scene representation provides general scene metadata and preview and gives access to direct scene download. A list of search results can also be exported for those who prefer batch scripting the download of all scenes in one go.
The extended EOSS catalog, to be released soon, will provide scene processing as a service which will include standard atmospheric correction, image segmentation and feature extraction.
